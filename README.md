Baby Grand, a mechanical keyboard, designed by me.
This keyboard is a minimalistic 31-key, alpha-staggered, choc only caseless board.

my pic again, now with the PCBs

Build with standard SMD keyboard diodes, any CHOC-type low-profile switch, and any pro micro/equivalent. Using whatever custom QMK environment (I recommend QMK MSYS) you use for other keyboards, add `babygrandv2` to your `keyboards` folder, edit the keymap, compile and flash. 

This repository contains Gerber files, if you would like to order your own circuit boards. As this was a learning experience, please do not expect any sort of support for this keyboard in the future.
